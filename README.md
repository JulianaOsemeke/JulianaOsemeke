Hi, I'm Juliana :wave:
![Readme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60651373/122753955-e557fa00-d28a-11eb-8ab3-b7c2c4c03421.png)


I transitioned from finance to tech and I am presently a trainee full-stack software developer @microverseinc where I am currently learning Rails, Javascript, React, and Redux. I am interested in collaborating with devs globally. With a flair for creative writing, I intend to transfer this skill to technical writing. Technologies I am passionate about include bootstrap 5, rails, and Javascript.
